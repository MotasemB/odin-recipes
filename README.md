It has a home page which linked to three different HTML files, each one with a different recipe.

Each recipe has an HTML file that had the following:

- Image of Food
  
- Description of the Food 
    
- Ingredients of the Food in an **Unordered List** 
    
- Steps on Making the Food in an **Ordered List**
