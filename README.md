This was a simple HTML website created to be able to display different recipes.

It had a home page which linked to three different HTML files, each one with a different recipe.

Each recipe file had the following:

- an image
  
- description of the food 
    
- ingredients of the food in an unordered list 
    
- steps on how to make the food in an ordered list
