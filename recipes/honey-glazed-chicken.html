    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This honey chicken recipe was given to me by a friend. I've used this recipe for years, 
        and my family requests it often. It's a light meal that everyone will enjoy. Serve with steamed rice.
    </p>
    <p>It's incredibly easy recipe! All you'll do is combine the honey glaze ingredients and pour it over the chicken wings in a casserole dish.
       Then you'll bake the wings for an hour until the chicken is cooked through.That's it!
